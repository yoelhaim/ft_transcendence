## MVC (Model-View-Controller)

is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic

The model represents the data and business logic
The view represents the user interface
The controller handles user input and manages the flow of data between the model and the view

1. Prisma: data models
2. NextJS: views
3. NestJS: application controllers
